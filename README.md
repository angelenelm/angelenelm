### hi there 👋 i'm angelene (she/her), a frontend software engineer from sunny san diego, california 👩🏻‍💻

Hi there! I’m currently a frontend software engineer and Computer Scientist at NIWC Pacific, building intuitive and accessible digital experiences to solve tough information challenges for the US Navy.

I first became engrossed in web design/development as a kid throwing together basic web pages for my Neopets, then as a tween modifying themes for my Tumblr blog. Now I love conceptualizing, designing, and developing new worlds on the Internet to share my interests and contribute to causes I am passionate about.

- Languages: ```Typescript/Javascript``` ```HTML``` ```CSS```
- Libraries & Frameworks: ```React``` ```React Router (Remix)``` ```Next.js```
- Tools & Platforms: ```Git``` ```Figma``` ```Sketch App``` ```Adobe Photoshop``` ```Adobe Illustrator```



In my spare time, I'm probably playing Final Fantasy.
