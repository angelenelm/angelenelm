### hi there 👋 i'm angelene (she/her), a frontend software engineer from sunny san diego, california 👩🏻‍💻

**Currently:** Fullstack Software Engineering Fellow at [Formation](https://formation.dev) and Frontend Developer for [Hack for LA](https://hackforla.org) 🌆

I'm a UC Irvine Computer Science alum looking to help build beautiful and accessible internet experiences ✨

I first became engrossed in web design/development as a kid throwing together basic web pages for my Neopets, then as a tween modifying themes for my Tumblr blog. Now I love conceptualizing, designing, and developing new worlds on the Internet to share my interests and contribute to causes I am passionate about.

- Languages: ```Javascript``` ```HTML``` ```CSS```
- Libraries & Frameworks: ```React``` ```Next.js```
- Tools & Platforms: ```Git``` ```Vercel``` ```Figma``` ```Sketch App``` ```Adobe Photoshop``` ```Adobe Illustrator```



In my spare time, I'm probably hiking, watching Critical Role, or playing Final Fantasy.
